# Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Project

## Project Overview
The Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of Alzheimer's disease in individuals based on various health and demographic features. The project utilizes a dataset containing information about patients, including genetic risk factors, age, and other relevant medical indicators.

## Objectives
- To analyze and preprocess the dataset to ensure data quality.
- To implement various machine learning algorithms to predict Alzheimer's disease.
- To evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- To explore techniques for handling class imbalance, including oversampling and undersampling methods.
- To provide insights into the factors contributing to Alzheimer's disease prediction.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:
- **Age**: The age of the patients.
- **Genetic Risk Factor**: A numerical value representing the genetic predisposition to Alzheimer's disease.
- **Other Health Indicators**: Various medical indicators relevant to Alzheimer's diagnosis.

The target variable is the **Alzheimer Diagnosis**, which indicates whether a patient has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (Yes/No).

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize data distributions and relationships to identify patterns and correlations.
3. **Model Training**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest and others.
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Assess model performance using various metrics, focusing on improving recall for positive cases.


## Conclusion
The project aims to provide a reliable tool for early prediction of Alzheimer's disease, enabling timely intervention and better patient outcomes. By leveraging machine learning techniques and addressing data challenges, this project seeks to contribute valuable insights to the field of healthcare and Alzheimer's research.
